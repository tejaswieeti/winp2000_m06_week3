  functioning as a bridge between software and physical hardware. Similar to other operating systems like Windows, iOS. Linux powers various platforms, 
  including Android, by facilitating communication between software and hardware.It is also a clone of the UNIX operating system, enabling software to function seamlessly on a wide range of devices.
